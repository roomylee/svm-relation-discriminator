The most common DIS00infection caused by BAC00A0_baumannii is hospital acquired DIS00pneumonia , and the associated mortality rate is approximately 50 %.	cause
Neither in vivo nor ex vivo expression profiling has been performed at the proteomic or transcriptomic level for DIS00pneumonia caused by BAC00A0_baumannii .	cause
This study is the first comprehensive overview of the ex vivo proteome of BAC00A0_baumannii and is an important step towards identification of diagnostic biomarkers, novel drug targets and potential vaccine candidates in the fight against DIS00pneumonia caused by BAC00A0_baumannii .	cause
