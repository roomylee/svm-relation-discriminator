Control measures for the most common causes of DIS00death in farmed mink include testing and removal of positive animals (Aleutian mink disease), vaccination ( DIS00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_pneumonia , DIS00mink_viral_enteritis ), avoidance of DIS00obesity in mink ( DIS00hepatic_lipidosis ), and environmental management, including maintaining clean water cups, floors, feed troughs, cages, feed silos, feed truck tires, workers' shoes, dining areas for farm personnel, leather mink handling gloves, street clothes, and coveralls.

In this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine, Earl et al (2015) report a potentially baleful relationship between steroid and antibiotic treatment in chronic DIS00respiratory_diseases , affecting colonization persistence and antibiotic tolerance for BAC00Haemophilus_influenzae , one of the leading potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) of the respiratory system.	None
We previously demonstrated that BAC00Neisseria_gonorrhoeae , a gram-negative pathogen responsible for the sexually transmitted DIS00infection_gonorrhea , protects against exogenous induction of apoptosis in human cervical epithelial cells.	responsible
The factors that dictate the role of BAC00S0_aureus in disease are still being determined.	None
