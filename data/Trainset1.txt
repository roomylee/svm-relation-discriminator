CONCLUSIONS: In baboon live DIS00E0_coli_sepsis , the salutary effect of rBPI21 results from a more prevalent antibacterial than antiendotoxin activity.	0
BACKGROUND: BAC00Escherichia_coli ( BAC00E0_coli ) strains, expressing S-fimbriae, belong to the most common gram-negative pathogens that cause DIS00sepsis and DIS00meningitis in neonates.	1
In addition, among the extracellular products, those which have cytotoxic activity to Vero cells may contribute to the lethality in DIS00sepsis caused by BAC00S0_aureus in this murine model.	1
He had developed BAC00pseudaerug bacteremia and later a therapy refractive DIS00pneumonia caused by aspergillus which had led to respiratory failure.	0
DIS00Streptococcus_pneumoniae_infection and disease have been modeled in several animal species including infant and adult mice, infant and adult rats, infant Rhesus monkeys, and adolescent and adult chinchillas.	0
It is concluded that BAC00E0_coli -induced DIS00sepsis causes decreased activities of Complex I and Complex II in DIS00baboon_heart_mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner.	1
BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae , the pneumococcus, is the most common cause of DIS00sepsis and DIS00meningitis .	1
We evaluated the effect of antiflagellar human monoclonal antibody on gut-derived DIS00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_sepsis .	0
Cyclophosphamide was then administered to induce DIS00leukopenia and translocation of the BAC00P0_aeruginosa that had colonized the gastrointestinal tract, thereby producing gut-derived generalized DIS00sepsis .	1
Our results indicate that antiflagellar human monoclonal antibody SC-1225 protects mice against gut-derived DIS00sepsis caused by BAC00P0_aeruginosa and suggest that such an effect is due to its opsonophagocytic activity and the reduced motility of the translocated bacteria once the bacteria move from the intestine into the bloodstream.	1
The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial DIS00sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of BAC00Listeria_monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal DIS00sepsis .	1
The aim of this study was to assess the importance of complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) in DIS00Staphylococcus_aureus_arthritis and DIS00sepsis .	0
We conclude that treatment with CR1 MoAb leads to amelioration of DIS00sepsis -induced mortality during DIS00S0_aureus_infection , possibly as a result of the increased phagocytic activity of peripheral phagocytes.	1
The effect of passive immunotherapy with antisera against heat-killed BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa and three of its exo-enzymes (elastase, alkaline protease and exotoxin A) in gut-derived DIS00P0_aeruginosa_sepsis was evaluated.	0
Cyclophosphamide was then administered to induce translocation of BAC00P0_aeruginosa that had colonised the gastrointestinal tract so that gut-derived DIS00septicaemia was produced.	0
These results indicate that passive immunisation with antiserum against heat-killed bacteria and exotoxin A, but not with antiserum against either elastase or alkaline protease, protects mice against gut-derived DIS00sepsis caused by BAC00P0_aeruginosa .	1
Of the organisms encountered, BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus was the most frequently occurring organism (39%), followed by coliform bacilli (24%), which was the most prevalent organism (44%) in post-operative DIS00sepsis .	1
BACKGROUND: To evaluate clinical and microbiological characteristics of DIS00sepsis due to BAC00Corynebacterium_amycolatum , because few cases have been reported in human DIS00infections by this bacteria.	1
METHODS: We report two cases of DIS00sepsis due to BAC00Corynebacterium_amycolatum , the patients were diagnosed as having DIS00leukaemia .	1
To evaluate the protective effect of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin against penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant strains of BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae , an intraperitoneal, immunocompetent mouse model of DIS00sepsis was used.	0
Norepinephrine stimulates growth of BAC00Escherichia_coli , BAC00Yersinia_enterocolitica , and BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa in serum-supplemented media, and in vivo increases in norepinephrine may be important in the pathogenesis of DIS00sepsis by gram-negative bacteria.	0
Conditioned medium produced with norepinephrine stimulated growth of S. choleraesuis but not BAC00E0_coli , whereas conditioned medium produced without norepinephrine stimulated growth of both bacteria.	0
The significant resistance to antibiotics was present in 47% of Gram-negative DIS00sepsis (causative microorganisms were BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa and BAC00Acinetobacter species) and in 18% of Gram-positive DIS00sepsis (susceptibility to imipenem only in Gram-negative DIS00sepsis and susceptibility to vankomycin in Gram-positive DIS00sepsis ).	0
BACKGROUND: BAC00Klebsiella_pneumoniae is a major cause of neonatal DIS00sepsis and DIS00nosocomial_infections in Mexico.	1
BAC00Yersinia_enterocolitica accounts for 50% of the clinical DIS00sepsis episodes caused by the transfusion of contaminated red blood cells.	1
The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of several factors causing translocation of indigenous microflora in an experimental model of DIS00septic_shock based on intraperitoneal DIS00Escherichia_coli_sepsis in rats.	0
Counts of inoculated BAC00E0_coli and translocated bacteria in different locations, gut morphology and haematological values were evaluated at different stages of DIS00sepsis .	0
In early DIS00sepsis , translocation was associated with high BAC00E0_coli counts in blood, yet in late DIS00sepsis the opposite correlation was present.	1
CONCLUSIONS: BAC00P0_aeruginosa may act as a pathogen in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in altered epithelial barrier function and DIS00death in a susceptible host.	0
The aim of this study was to determine if TNF-alpha plays an important role in early DIS00death from DIS00Escherichia_coli_sepsis in the newborn animal and if blocking TNF improves survival.	0
In this study, mechanisms of DIS00myocardial_dysfunction were examined in a porcine model of DIS00Escherichia_coli_sepsis .	0
One patient had catheter-related DIS00sepsis with BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus .	0
Also, whereas NE-deficient mice had impaired survival in response to DIS00E0_coli_sepsis , as compared to wild-type mice, the presence or absence of NE had no influence on survival in response to DIS00sepsis that had been induced with OmpA-deficient BAC00E0_coli .	1
The immunotherapies were developed in the late 1960s and put into widespread use in the Soviet Union for the prophylaxis and treatment of DIS00sepsis , DIS00pneumonia , and other conditions caused by an epidemic of antibiotic-resistant BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus .	0
The common pathogens were BAC00Escherichia_coli (57%), BAC00Enterococcus (27%), DIS00Klebsiella_pneumonia (18%), BAC00Morganella_morganii (7.6%), BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa (4.1%) and BAC00Salmonella (0.7%).	0
Coagulase negative BAC00Staphylococcus (CONS) (50%) was the most common infecting organism causing late onset DIS00sepsis (LOS) and BAC00Escherichia_coli (29%) the most common causing early onset DIS00sepsis (EOS).	1
The primary disease was DIS00sepsis in these three patients; BAC00S0_aureus was cultured from blood in two patients and Gram-positive cocci was observed following examination of the joint fluid in the other patient.	1
By using a similar experimental setup, severe DIS00hyperdynamic_sepsis was induced (n = 15) by intravenous infusion of live BAC00Escherichia_coli (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/kg) over 2 hrs, followed by antibiotic therapy (gentamicin 4 mg/kg twice a day).	1
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma PCT at baseline was barely detectable, but levels increased significantly (p < .05) to 2+/-1.8 pg/mL 2 hrs after the start of reperfusion in the shock group, and to 987+/-230 pg/mL at 4 hrs after BAC00E0_coli in the DIS00sepsis group.	0
PCT levels were approximately three times higher in the DIS00sepsis group than in the shock group, corresponding to endotoxin levels (at the end of DIS00hemorrhage , 286+/-144 pg/mL vs. 3576+/-979 pg/mL at the end of BAC00E0_coli infusion; p = .003).	0
RESULTS: All examples of BAC00B0_cereus , BAC00P0_aeruginosa , BAC00K0_pneumoniae , BAC00S0_marcescens , and BAC00S0_aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL by Day 3 after inoculation.	0
DIS00Burkholderia_cepacia_sepsis /pneumonia was the second most lethal DIS00infection in patients in the registry.	0
Subsequently she developed DIS00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_sepsis and DIS00purpura at the leading edge of the plaque.	0
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low "stretch" mechanical ventilation protects animals from clinical DIS00sepsis after direct acute DIS00lung_injury with BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa as compared with high "stretch" ventilation.	0
We hypothesized that administration of a monoclonal antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54), a molecule mediating neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, would decrease neutrophil sequestration and transmigration in the lung and attenuate DIS00lung_injury in DIS00Escherichia_coli_sepsis .	0
These data show that monoclonal antibody to CD54 does not ameliorate DIS00acute_lung_injury in DIS00E0_coli_sepsis , and septic primates given anti-CD54 have worsened metabolic parameters and decreased survival.	0
OBJECTIVE: Report of 8 cases of disseminated DIS00infection with BAC00V0_vulnificus causing fulminant DIS00sepsis . DESIGN: Series of cases.	1
CONCLUSION: The DIS00V0_vulnificus_infection appears in patients with DIS00chronic_liver_disease and it is associated with high mortality.	0
Notably, blockade of TREM-1 protects mice against DIS00LPS -induced DIS00shock , as well as microbial DIS00sepsis caused by live BAC00Escherichia_coli or caecal ligation and puncture.	1
BAC00Streptococcus_agalactiae (group B streptococcus, DIS00GBS ) is the major pathogen of neonatal DIS00sepsis .	1
To determine the role of endogenous IL-10 in local antibacterial host defense and in the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome during DIS00abdominal_sepsis , IL-10 gene-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) and wild-type (IL-10(+/+)) mice received an i.p. injection with BAC00Escherichia_coli .	0
The results suggest that activation of the contact system at the surface of BAC00S0_aureus and the subsequent release of bradykinin could contribute to the DIS00hypovolemic_hypotension seen in patients with severe DIS00S0_aureus_sepsis .	1
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria include the enteric gram-negative bacilli, especially BAC00Escherichia_coli , BAC00Klebsiella and BAC00Enterobacter , and BAC00Haemophilus_influenzae type b, a major respiratory tract pathogen and cause of DIS00meningitis .	1
During the last few years, there has been an increased number of case reports claiming an association of BAC00C0_xerosis with DIS00diseases , like DIS00septicemia , DIS00endocarditis , DIS00pleuropneumonia , DIS00peritonitis , DIS00osteomyelitis , DIS00septic_arthritis , mediastinitis, DIS00meningitis , DIS00ventriculitis specially in immunocompromised patients or surgical patients.	0
We report a case of DIS00sepsis due to BAC00C0_xerosis in a newborn without evident DIS00immunodeficiency .	1
Severe DIS00hyperdynamic_sepsis was induced in baboons (n = 14) by i.v. infusion of live BAC00E0_coli (approximately 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/kg) over 2 h. Animals were pretreated 2 h before BAC00E0_coli either with 1 mg/kg humanized anti-TNF antibody (CDP571) or placebo (Ringer solution).	1
We conclude that PCT levels are not dependent on the systemic presence of DIS00TNF in an DIS00E0_coli_sepsis model in baboons.	0
To determine the relative contribution of lipopolysaccharide ( DIS00LPS ) and non- DIS00LPS components of BAC00Neisseria_meningitidis to the pathogenesis of DIS00meningococcal_sepsis , this study quantitatively compared cytokine induction by isolated DIS00LPS , wild-type serogroup B meningococci (strain H44/76), and DIS00LPS -deficient mutant meningococci (strain H44/76[pLAK33]).	0
The principal conclusion is that non-LPS parts of BAC00N0_meningitidis may play a role in the pathogenesis of DIS00meningococcal_sepsis by inducing substantial TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma production.	1
Plasma was collected from thermally injured rats with BAC00E0_coli O18 DIS00sepsis and filtered. DIS00LPS was affinity-purified from plasma filtrates using monoclonal antibody specific for the O-polysaccharide side chain of BAC00E0_coli O18 DIS00LPS .	0
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability during DIS00sepsis with BAC00Escherichia_coli or BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae was examined in a mouse model and measured by a circulating beta-galactosidase tracer.	0
The increase of BBB permeability induced by BAC00E0_coli and BAC00S0_pneumoniae , which was maximal at 3 h and 12 h after injection, respectively, was transient because of rapid clearance of the bacteria from the blood.	0
The increase in BBB permeability induced by either BAC00E0_coli or BAC00S0_pneumoniae could be inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody.	0
We describe the atypical presentation of a fatal DIS00C0_canimorsus0sepsis in a 46-year-old man, who underwent traumatic splenectomy two decades earlier.	0
A model of ALI was used in which adult baboons were primed with killed BAC00Escherichia_coli (1 x 10(9) CFU/kg), and DIS00bacteremic_sepsis was induced 12 h later by infusion of live BAC00E0_coli at 1 x 10(10) CFU/kg.	0
Here we report initial data on blockade of TF-initiated DIS00coagulation in baboons with DIS00Escherichia_coli_sepsis -induced ALI, using active site-inactivated FVIIa (FVIIai ASIS).	0
Recombinant MIF was found to exacerbate lethal DIS00endotoxemia or bacterial DIS00sepsis when co-injected with DIS00LPS or BAC00Escherichia_coli in mice.	0

BAC00Streptococcus_pyogenes causes severe invasive DIS00diseases in humans, including DIS00necrotizing_fasciitis , DIS00sepsis , and DIS00streptococcal_toxic_shock_syndrome (STSS).	1
In addition, a human clinical isolate of BAC00P0_aeruginosa , strain PA14, also causes disease in a variety of nonvertebrate hosts, including plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella.	1
Mutation of the ybtQ homolog in BAC00P0_aeruginosa strain PA14 significantly attenuates the virulence of this strain in both G. mellonella and a burned mouse model of DIS00sepsis to levels comparable to those seen with PAO1.	0
BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae is an important cause of upper and lower DIS00respiratory_tract_infections , DIS00meningitis , DIS00peritonitis , bacterial DIS00arthritis , and DIS00sepsis .	1
BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae is the commonest infecting organism, accounting for 50-90% of isolates from blood cultures in reported series; it is particularly common in children with DIS00sickle_cell_disease .	0
These are surgical conservation of the spleen; immunization against BAC00S0_pneumoniae , BAC00Haemophilus_influenzae type b, and BAC00Neisseria_meningitidis ; prophylactic antibiotics; stand-by antibiotics; patient information sheets; and a medical alert bracelet.	0
BAC00Streptococcus_suis capsular type 2 is an important aetiologic agent of swine DIS00meningitis , and it has been highlighted as a cause of DIS00occupational_disease leading to DIS00meningitis and fulminant DIS00sepsis in humans.	1
The synergistic effect of the up-regulation of cytokines during DIS00S0_suis_meningitis may mediate many of the inflammatory reactions, including the sequestration of leucocytes at the site of DIS00infection .	0
Mice infected with the gram-negative bacterium BAC00Salmonella_enterica serovar Typhimurium exhibit marked genetic differences in disease manifestation, and the wild-derived strain Mus musculus molossinus MOLF/Ei is extremely susceptible to BAC00S0_enterica serovar Typhimurium.	0
CONCLUSIONS: BPI has a marked protective effect on DIS00E0_coli_sepsis , which might be related to its action against bacterial endotoxin and its inhibition of TNFalpha production in DIS00sepsis .	0
WT mice immunized with type 3 BAC00Streptococcus_pneumoniae capsular PS made anti-PS IgM, IgG3, and small quantities of IgG1, which opsonized BAC00S0_pneumoniae for killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.	0
OBJECTIVE: To determine if decreasing levels of intestinal cell death improves survival in a murine model of DIS00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_pneumonia -induced DIS00sepsis .	0
IL-1R-deficient mice (IL-1R(-/-)) and their wild-type controls (IL-1R(+/+)) were i.v. inoculated with 1 x 10(7) or 10(6) BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus per mouse to mimic bacterial DIS00sepsis and DIS00septic_arthritis .	0
In conclusion, IL-1R signaling plays a crucial role in host protection during systemic DIS00S0_aureus_infection as seen by the fatal outcome of DIS00S0_aureus_sepsis and DIS00arthritis in IL-1R-deficient mice.	0
BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus is one of the most significant pathogens in human DIS00sepsis and DIS00endocarditis .	0
BAC00S0_aureus can initiate DIS00blood_coagulation , leading to the formation of microthrombi and multiorgan dysfunction in DIS00sepsis , whereas in DIS00endocarditis the bacterium induces fibrin clots on the inner surface of the heart, so-called endocardial vegetations.	0

Early DIS00sepsis occurs during the first week and presents in the form of frank clinical features ( DIS00pain , DIS00erythema , DIS00penile_discharge ); highly virulent bacteria are isolated, such as BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus .	0
Late DIS00sepsis occurs after an interval of several weeks to several months with less specific clinical features; BAC00Staphylococcus_epidermidis is isolated in more than 50% of cases.	0
CONCLUSION: Supplementary BAC00L0_plantarum 299 was effective in reducing DIS00pancreatic_sepsis and the number of surgical interventions.	0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect and its underlying mechanism of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CHI), on postburn BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus ( BAC00S0_aureus ) DIS00sepsis in rats.	0
To further assess the role of BAK in DIS00sepsis in DIS00acute_renal_failure , dogs were nephrectomized and 48 h later administered intraperitoneally with 30 x 10(10) bacteria/kg of BAC00E0_coli .	0
BACKGROUND: BAC00Yersinia_enterocolitica , BAC00Pseudomonas_fluorescens , and BAC00P0_putida are responsible for a significant amount of the bacterial DIS00sepsis cases attributed to RBC transfusions.	1
BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa is a pathogen that frequently causes DIS00acute_lung_injury , DIS00bacteremia and DIS00sepsis in critically ill patients.	1
As tissue macrophages are a major producer of inflammatory mediators that contribute to septic physiology, and are essential for eliminating bacteria from the circulation, we investigated the role of tissue macrophages in the generation of both inflammatory and ant`i-inflammatory cytokines in DIS00septic_shock by using our mouse model of DIS00P0_aeruginosa_pneumonia .	0
Although depletion of tissue macrophages by Cl2MDP-liposome administration did not affect the severity of DIS00bacteremia or the survival of infected mice, these results imply that tissue macrophages have a major role in the production of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the circulation and in the causing septic physiology associated with DIS00P0_aeruginosa_pneumonia .	0
One week later, he was admitted to our hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with DIS00sepsis associated with four species of bacteria ( BAC00Streptococcus_constellatus , BAC00Fusobacterium_mortiferum , BAC00Bacteroides_thetaiotaomicron , and non-spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive bacillus).	1

Cephtriaxon is the drug of choice for BAC00E0_coli and DIS00Hemophilus_influence_meningitis .	1
The results of bacteriological cultures of liver, spleen and kidney specimens led to the diagnosis of DIS00Acinetobacter_baumannii_sepsis .	0
DIS00Vibrio_vulnificus_infection can result in DIS00necrotizing_fasciitis and DIS00sepsis , which have short latentcy periods and high mortality rates.	1
The pathological basis of DIS00hearing_loss in bacterial DIS00meningitis was investigated using an animal model of DIS00Streptococcus_suis_meningitis .	0
We report the first case of DIS00U0_urealyticum_meningitis in a premature infant in Korea.	0
In DIS00acute_meningitis of prematures already colonized with BAC00U0_urealyticum , ureaplasmal cultures and susceptibility test are warranted in Korea.	1
In this Commentary, we consider these findings and propose possible mechanisms by which RAGE exacts a heavy toll on the host in response to polymicrobial DIS00sepsis and BAC00L0_monocytogenes .	0
Methicillin-resistant BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus (MRSA), BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa and BAC00Acinetobacter_baumannii were predominant causative agents in both type of DIS00sepsis .	1
BAC00E0_coli hemolysin and, possibly, other related cytolysins may thus contribute directly to the pathogenesis of acute DIS00respiratory_failure under conditions of DIS00sepsis or DIS00pneumonia .	1
BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus is a known cause of a variety of illnesses that present to the emergency department, including skin and soft tissue DIS00infections , DIS00pneumonia , and DIS00sepsis .	1
We discuss the case of a young adult developing an overwhelming post-splenectomy DIS00sepsis (OPSS) due to streptococcus pneumoniae seven years after the splenectomy for a DIS00traumatic_injury .	1
DIS00Lemierre0s_syndrome is characterized by severe DIS00infection , with DIS00pharyngitis , DIS00sepsis and DIS00thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, and is most frequently associated with DIS00upper_airway_infection with BAC00Fusobacterium_necrophorum , often preceded by DIS00infection with Epstein-Barr virus which enables bacteria growing in the oral cavity to invade.	0
DIS00Francisella_tularensis_subsp0_novicida intranasal DIS00infection causes a rapid DIS00pneumonia in mice with mortality at 4 to 6 days with a low dose of bacteria (10(2) bacteria).	0
We developed a live BAC00Escherichia_coli model of acute DIS00sepsis in pigs with emphasize on biomarkers reflecting the early inflammatory response of DIS00sepsis .	0
The aim of this study was to analyze if these two amino acids which are vital for the fibrinogen binding of ClfA are of importance for the ability of BAC00S0_aureus to generate disease.	0
Our data strongly suggest that the fibrinogen binding activity of ClfA is crucial for the ability of BAC00S0_aureus to provoke disease manifestations, and that the vaccine potential of recombinant ClfA is improved by removing its ability to bind fibrinogen.	1
CONCLUSIONS: BAC00B0_cepacia may be an etiologic agent of severe hospital acquired DIS00pneumonia and DIS00sepsis among immunocompromised patients. Clinically DIS00infection develops picture of superinfection and usually is life-threatening condition.	1
BAC00Streptococcus_suis is a major cause of DIS00meningitis , DIS00sepsis and DIS00arthritis in piglets and a zoonotic agent.	0
CASE SUMMARY: A premature infant was diagnosed with DIS00C0_koseri_sepsis after 3 weeks in intensive care.	0
Based on favorable sensitivity data, penetration into neutrophils and the CNS, and favorable DIS00toxicity profiles, ciprofloxacin and meropenem would appear to be the most appropriate antibiotic treatment options for DIS00systemic_infection_or_meningitis caused by BAC00C0_koseri .	1
CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin and meropenem should be considered antibiotic treatment options for DIS00systemic_infection_or_meningitis caused by BAC00C0_koseri .	1
In this model mimicking human disease, the inflammatory response to BAC00N0_meningitidis was closely associated with the bacterial concentration.	0
BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus is a common etiologic agent for Gram-positive DIS00sepsis , and its lipoteichoic acid (LTA) may be important in causing Gram-positive bacterial DIS00septic_shock .	1
It is frequently caused by BAC00S0_aureus and, in endemic areas, by BAC00Mycobacterium_tuberculosis and BAC00Brucella spp. We describe 9 cases, from October 2004 to August 2005, all spontaneous diseases occurring in adults (mean age 64 years).	0
In the present study, we investigated the role of CYLD in innate immune response in DIS00Escherichia_coli_pneumonia .	0
Upon BAC00E0_coli inoculation, Cyld(-/-) mice were hypersusceptible to DIS00E0_coli_pneumonia with higher mortality.	1
Furthermore, IKK inhibitor rescued Cyld(-/-) mice from lethal DIS00infection during DIS00E0_coli_pneumonia along with reduced DIS00inflammation .	0
Taken together, these data showed that CYLD acts as a crucial negative regulator for DIS00E0_coli_pneumonia by negatively regulating NF-kappaB.	0
We presently have demonstrated that recombinant N-terminal lectinlike domain of TM (rTMD1) functions as a protective agent against DIS00sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacterial DIS00infections . rTMD1 caused agglutination of BAC00Escherichia_coli and BAC00Klebsiella_pneumoniae and enhanced the macrophage phagocytosis of these Gram-negative bacteria.	0
BAC00Neisseria_meningitidis is a leading cause of DIS00meningitis and DIS00septicemia worldwide, with a rapid onset of disease and a high morbidity and mortality.	1
