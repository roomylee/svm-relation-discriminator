UNASSIGNED: BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus ( BAC00S0_aureus ) is an important human pathogen that causes several diseases ranging from superficial DIS00skin_infections to life-threatening diseases.	1
UNASSIGNED: The leading risk factor for DIS00gastric_cancer in humans is DIS00infection by BAC00Helicobacter_pylori strains that express and translocate the oncoprotein CagA into host epithelial cells.	1
Our results identify previously uncharacterized regions distributed throughout the protein sequence of ASPP2 as determinants of CagA binding, providing mechanistic insight into apoptosis reprogramming by CagA and potential new drug targets for BAC00H0_pylori -mediated DIS00gastric_cancer .	0
BACKGROUND: Listeriosis, mostly caused by BAC00Listeria_monocytogenes species, has become a major concern to public health authorities due to its clinical severity and high mortality rate, particularly in high risk groups.	1
However, severe DIS00sepsis can occur after TRUS prostate biopsies, with BAC00Escherichia_coli being the predominant causative agent.	1
METHODS: We compared BAC00E0_coli isolates from male patients with DIS00bacteremic_urinary_tract_infection (B-UTI) to isolates of patients with post prostate biopsy DIS00sepsis (PPBS), in terms of their sequence types, determined by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and their virulence markers.	1
BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus that produce PVL are responsible for severe DIS00diseases , including DIS00necrotizing_pneumonia .	1
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin produced by BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus , responsible for neutrophil damage and key player of severe staphylococcal DIS00diseases .	1
UNASSIGNED: The fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has potent activity against BAC00Mycobacterium_tuberculosis and has been recommended by the guidelines for the treatment of DIS00pulmonary_tuberculosis (TB).	0
UNASSIGNED: Between 2010 and 2014, we obtained swab specimens to detect BAC00Treponema_pallidum , with PCR assays, from the oral cavities of 240 patients with 267 episodes of syphilis who reported engaging in unprotected sex practices.	0
UNASSIGNED: BAC00Neisseria_meningitidis can cause severe and fulminant diseases such as DIS00meningitis . Meningococcal capsular polysaccharide (PS) is a key virulence determinant that is not able to induce immunological memory.	1
During an inflammatory response in the gut, some commensal bacteria such as BAC00E0_coli can thrive and contribute to disease.	1
These findings define a fundamental mechanism by which BAC00E0_coli surpasses the host innate immune responses during inflammatory gut DIS00diseases and gains a distinct survival advantage.	0
The BAC00V0_antiquarius genome encodes genes and operons with ecological functions relevant to the environment conditions of the deep sea and also harbors factors known to be involved in human disease caused by freshwater, coastal, and brackish water vibrios.	1
BAC00Xanthomonas_albilineans causes leaf scald, a lethal disease of sugarcane. Compared to other species of BAC00Xanthomonas , BAC00X0_albilineans exhibits distinctive pathogenic mechanisms, ecology and taxonomy.	1
BACKGROUND: BAC00Neisseria_lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against DIS00meningococcal_meningitis .	1
FTIR analysis was performed to assess the chemical linkages, and antimicrobial assays were performed with two strains: BAC00Staphylococcus_aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) and DIS00Klebsiella_pneumonia (Gram-negative bacterium).	0
UNASSIGNED: The BAC00Bordetella_pertussis polymerase chain reaction positivity rate changed after additional DIS00diphtheria0tetanus -acellular pertussis boosters in 2005 and 2008, 9.8%, 13.4%, 22% and 15.2% in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, P < 0.001, respectively.	0
BAC00Mycobacterium_smegmatis mc(2)155 cells heterologously expressing the DIS00M0_tuberculosis ctpA gene displayed an increased tolerance to toxic levels of the Cu(2+) ion (4 mM) compared to control cells, suggesting that CtpA is possibly involved in the copper detoxification of mycobacterial cells.	0
UNASSIGNED: Infection with F4(+) DIS00enterotoxigenic_Escherichia_coli (ETEC) responsible for DIS00diarrhea in neonatal and post-weaned piglets leads to great economic losses in the swine industry.	1
CagA-positive BAC00H0_pylori is associated with an increased risk for DIS00gastric_cancer compared with negative strains.	1
The Lyme disease spirochete BAC00Borrelia_burgdorferi migrates to distant sites in the tick vectors and mammalian hosts through robust motility and chemotaxis activities.	0
In this article, we studied how two proteins, called FliH and FliI, are important for the production of full-length flagella in the Lyme disease spirochete BAC00Borrelia_burgdorferi .	0
Mutants with defective production of FliH and FliI have reduced flagellar length and motility; this deficiency in turn affects many aspects of B. burgdorferi's biology, including the ability to undergo cell division and cause disease in mammals.	0
